 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to create a Flask application that shows the latest tweets of a user. The application should have the following features:

* A home page that shows the latest tweets of the user.
* A page that shows the user's profile information.
* A page that allows the user to edit their profile information.
* A page that allows the user to follow other users.
* A page that allows the user to see their followers.

## Design

The application will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The home page of the application.
* `profile.html`: The page that shows the user's profile information.
* `edit_profile.html`: The page that allows the user to edit their profile information.
* `follow.html`: The page that allows the user to follow other users.
* `followers.html`: The page that allows the user to see their followers.

The application will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page.
* `/profile`: The page that shows the user's profile information.
* `/edit_profile`: The page that allows the user to edit their profile information.
* `/follow`: The page that allows the user to follow other users.
* `/followers`: The page that allows the user to see their followers.

The application will use the following Flask views to handle the requests:

* `index()`: The view that handles the home page.
* `profile()`: The view that handles the page that shows the user's profile information.
* `edit_profile()`: The view that handles the page that allows the user to edit their profile information.
* `follow()`: The view that handles the page that allows the user to follow other users.
* `followers()`: The view that handles the page that allows the user to see their followers.

The application will use the following templates to render the HTML files:

* `index.html`: The template for the home page.
* `profile.html`: The template for the page that shows the user's profile information.
* `edit_profile.html`: The template for the page that allows the user to edit their profile information.
* `follow.html`: The template for the page that allows the user to follow other users.
* `followers.html`: The template for the page that allows the user to see their followers.

The application will use the following CSS files to style the HTML files:

* `style.css`: The main CSS file for the application.

The application will use the following JavaScript files to add interactivity to the HTML files:

* `scripts.js`: The main JavaScript file for the application.
